# API Routes Configuration - SGIP Real Estate
#
# This service has a SINGLE Next.js container (frontend only, no separate backend).
# All API routes are managed by the application:
#   - /api/uploads/*   (property images, thumbnails, files)
#   - /api/properties/*
#   - /api/developers/*
#   - /api/health
#   - etc.
#
# Nginx-microservice: when the registry has only a "frontend" service and no backend,
# the generated config has a single "location /" that proxies everything to the
# frontend. So /api/* and /_next/static/* all go to the Next.js app. No need to list
# routes here.
#
# Do NOT add a "backend" or "api-gateway" to this service's registry; that would
# create a generic "location /api/" block routing to a non-existent backend and
# would break API and image loading.
#
